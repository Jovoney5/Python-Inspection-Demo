Your Goal:
Export old rows (e.g. older than 1 year) to a .csv file or move them to another SQLite archive DB.

üí° Two smart options:
üÖ∞Ô∏è Option 1: Export to CSV (for cold storage)
Write a Python script (or SQL command inside Python) that:

Finds rows older than 1 year

Exports them to a .csv

Deletes them (optional) from the main database
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------
üÖ±Ô∏è Option 2: Move to an Archive SQLite DB
Write a script that:

Selects old rows

Inserts them into another SQLite archive file (e.g. archive_2023.db)

Deletes them from the live DB
